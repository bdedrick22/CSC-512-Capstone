Project Description:

This project will focus around the creation of a game which will teach the player the basics of Morse code.
Morse code is a form of communication that uses combinations of dashes and dots to represent each letter of the English alphabet and all ten decimal digits.
The game will teach the user the basics, then challenge them in each of the multiple ways of perceiving Morse code.

Tentative Timeline:

By Meeting #3 (9/22):
Find other examples of Morse code teachers/games. 
Find resources that I will need to be able to write the interpreter.

By Meeting #4 (10/6): 
Fully implement a Morse code interpreter in Python.

By Meeting #5 (10/20):
Choose GUI Library and implement working GUI.

By Meeting #6 (11/3):
Finish any loose ends, and have a completely working game.
