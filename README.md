Project Description:

This project will focus around the creation of a game which will teach the player the basics of Morse code.
Morse code is a form of communication that uses combinations of dashes and dots to represent each letter of the English alphabet and all ten decimal digits.
The game will teach the user the basics with a free play and challenge game mode.

You can create custom game packs easily!
To make a game pack open a new CSV file, make the first word "# Easy," then add in some number of easy words or phrases, one per line.
Once you've added enough, make a new line "# Hard," and repeat the process with some harder words or phrases.
Look at the included 'MC-TRAINING.csv' file for an example.

Happy playing!
