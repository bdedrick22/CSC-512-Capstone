Project Description:

This project will focus around the creation of a game which will teach the player the basics of Morse code.
Morse code is a form of communication that uses combinations of dashes and dots to represent each letter of the English alphabet and all ten decimal digits.
The game will teach the user the basics, then challenge them in each of the multiple ways of perceiving Morse code.
